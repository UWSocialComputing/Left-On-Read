Exploring passive methods of communication and connection.


# The project
Our product twyd was born out of the idea of capturing elements of passive human interaction in the physical space and carrying them over onto the online space.

Our [Github Repository](https://github.com/UWSocialComputing/Left-On-Read-Project) and blog posts document our development from start to end. Instructions on installation can be found in the [README.md](https://github.com/UWSocialComputing/Left-On-Read-Project#readme) file.
