*Exploring passive methods of communication and connection.*

## The project

Our product **twyd** ("that's what you're doing") was created out of the idea of capturing elements of passive human interaction in the physical space and carrying them over onto the online space.

Our [Github Repository](https://github.com/UWSocialComputing/Left-On-Read-Project) and blog posts document our development from start to end. Instructions on installation can be found in the [README.md](https://github.com/UWSocialComputing/Left-On-Read-Project#readme) file.
