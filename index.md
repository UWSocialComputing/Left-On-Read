*Exploring passive methods of communication and connection.* 

## The project

**twyd** ("that's what you're doing") was created out of the idea of capturing elements of passive human interaction in the physical space and carrying them over onto the online space.

## Features
twyd rooms allow you to connect with friends to simulate the feeling we get when we are working together in a room. 
### Keyboard Activity Indicator
The first feature lets you visualize a person's keyboard activity through a blink for each keystroke around their icon. "Hear" who's busy typing away!

### Current Tab Indicator
The second feature allows you to see what your friends are doing (aka what tab they're on) without having to ask!
